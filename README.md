# Park Alert

## Overview

Nature is one of our greatest resources.  As outdoor activities such as backpaking have become more popular the ability to get an access permit have become more difficult, many times resulting in reservations 6 months prior to date.  However, no one can predict when the next disaster will happen.  And when something does occur, 
 such as fire or snow or mudslide, parts of a park can close, including those with permit restrictions.  Planning for these trips can become compromised since most times you cannot predict when a park will re-open.

 My goal with this project was to make it easier for people to know when access becomes available again to allow the public.
