    <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
    <p> 
        Nature is one of our greatest resources.  <br />
        As outdoor activities such as backpaking have gained in popularity, 
        the ability to get an access permit has become more difficult.  
        Most of the best wilderness zone reservations need to be made 6 months prior to date.  
        However, no one can predict when the next disaster will happen.  When something does occur, 
        such as fire or mud slide, parts of a park can close.  Planning for these trips can become 
        compromised since most times you cannot predict when a park will re-open.
        <br /><br />
        My goal with this project is to make it easier for people to know when access becomes available again to allow the public.
